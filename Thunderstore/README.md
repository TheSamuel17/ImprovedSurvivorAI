# ImprovedSurvivorAI

For the most part, AI-controlled Survivors are plagued by egregiously low activation ranges, weird skill prioritization and an aversion towards sprinting when it would be appropriate to do so.

This mod rewrites the behavior tree of every single vanilla Survivor in the hopes of rendering them far more competent brawlers. It also grants them full awareness of their enemies' positions, ignoring both angle & line of sight requirements, although they will prioritize targets within line of sight if possible.

Also comes pre-packaged with improvements to the Engineer's mobile turrets; they now *always* sprint when following you, and their maximum attack range has been improved from **25m** to **35m**. These changes can be turned off.

This mod indirectly but *very* noticeably buffs Goobo Jr., so be on the lookout for that :P

Oh, and watch out for the Artifact of Vengeance.

## Mod Compatibility & Recommendations

This mod works with: [Enforcer, Nemesis Enforcer](https://thunderstore.io/package/EnforcerGang/Enforcer/), [Sonic](https://thunderstore.io/package/ds_gaming/SonicTheHedgehog/).

This mod is also best served with [AlliesAvoidImplosions](https://thunderstore.io/package/Chinchi/AlliesAvoidImplosions). It can be configured to allow Survivors to flee from Void implosions as well, using the **Additional Retreat Entities** entry.

## To-do:

* Make Artificer hover?
* CHEF's Roll.
* Re-implement Seeker's Sojourn into her behavior.
* The floodgates have open! I can make *your* modded survivor smarter, starting today! *For free!* (No promises, though, some of them are *real* complex.)
